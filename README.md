# DNA-Lang: Living Software Language

## Quickstart: Healthcare Platform Example

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Generate parser (if you change the grammar):**
   ```sh
   npx antlr4ts-cli -visitor -o src/parser grammar/dnaorganism.g4
   ```
3. **Parse a DNA-Lang file:**
   ```sh
   npx ts-node src/cli.ts examples/healthcare_platform.dna
   ```
   This will print the AST for a living healthcare platform organism, with genes for patient management, diagnostics, and compliance.

## Example: `examples/healthcare_platform.dna`

```
dnaorganism HealthcarePlatform {
  dna {
    version: "1.0";
    description: "A living healthcare platform organism";
    compliance: "HIPAA";
    region: "US";
  }
  genome {
    dnagene PatientManagement {
      purpose: "Manage patient records and access";
      mutations {
        anonymize {
          code: "// Remove PII from patient data";
        }
        mergeRecords {
          code: "// Merge duplicate patient records";
        }
      }
      dnaimmune_system {
        threat: "unauthorized_access";
        response: "block_and_alert";
      }
    }
    dnagene Diagnostics {
      purpose: "Run diagnostics and suggest treatments";
      mutations {
        addTest {
          code: "// Add new diagnostic test";
        }
        updateAlgorithm {
          code: "// Improve diagnostic accuracy";
        }
      }
      adaptive_responses {
        trigger: "new_disease";
        response: "auto_update_protocols";
      }
    }
    dnagene Compliance {
      purpose: "Ensure regulatory compliance";
      mutations {
        auditTrail {
          code: "// Log all access and changes";
        }
      }
      dnaimmune_system {
        threat: "policy_violation";
        response: "auto_lockdown";
      }
    }
  }
  agents {
    main: PatientManagement;
    diagnostics: Diagnostics;
    compliance: Compliance;
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
- Extend the runtime to simulate evolution, mutation, and agent collaboration.
- Add more genes and mutations for healthcare features (e.g., scheduling, billing, telemedicine).
- Integrate with real data and APIs for a full living healthcare platform.
